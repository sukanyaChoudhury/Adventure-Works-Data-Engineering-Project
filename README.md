# Adventure-Works-Data-Engineering-Project 
## Azure End to End Data Engineering Pipeline

This project builds an End-to-End Azure Data Engineering Solution. A Pipeline performing Data Ingestion, ETL and Analytics all-in-one solution using Microsoft Azure Services and Power BI.

## Goal of the Project

The goal is to create an Azure solution which can take data stored in web and move it to the Cloud. It does so by building an ETL pipeline using Azure Data Factory, Azure Databricks and Azure Synapse Analytics.

This solution can be connected to a visualization and reporting dashboard using Microsoft Power BI.

Data Migration to the Cloud is one of the most common scenarios the Data Engineers encounter when building solutions for a small-medium organization.
By working on this project, I was able to learn these skills:

* Data Ingestion
* ETL techniques using Azure Cloud Services
* Data Transformation
* Data Analytics and Dashboard Reporting
